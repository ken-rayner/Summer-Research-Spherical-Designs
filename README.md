# spherical_design
Spherical Design Code for Summer Research at the University of Auckland

These scripts construct designs of the desired order and size for the specified dimension.

Designs are constructed using Manopt for MATLAB to minimise the variational characterisation.

Current improvements I am exploring are:

  - Floating point error
  - Quaternionic algebra
